# Computer-Networking
1) What is Computer Networking
Computer Networking is the process of connecting two or more computers or devices so they can communicate and share data and resources

A network allows devices like computers,phones,and servers to talk to each other

Examples of devices in a network
Computers, Mobile phones, Servers(ec2 instances), Printers, Routers and switches

2) Why Computer Networking is Needed
Networking exists because it makes computing faster,easier,and more powerful

Resource Sharing
Share files, printers, storage and apllications
for example office employees sharing one printer

Communication
Email,messaging,video calls

Internet Access
Access websites, cloud apps, services
for example online shopping and learning

Data Management
Store data centrally on servers
for example company databases

Security and Backup
Centralized control and backups

3) Where Computer Networking is Used in Real Life
   At Home
   wi-fi router connects: Mobile phones, Smart Tvs, Laptops, Iot devices
   Companies
   Employee systems connected to: interbal servers, Databases, Printers,
   Schools&Colleges
   Online classes
   Student portals
   Banking Systems
   Atm networks
   online transactions
   E-commerce
   Websites like Amazon and flipkart
4) Basic components of a Network
   Every network has some basic components
   1) End Devices
      computers, phones,servers
   2) Networking Devices
      Router - Connects networks to internet
      Switch - Connects devices inside network
      Modem  - Connects to ISP
   3) Transmission Media
      wired: Ethernet cables
      Wireless: Wi-Fi,Bluetooth
   4) Protocols
      Rules that define communication
      HTTP(web)
      FTP(file transfer)
      TCP/IP(core internet protocol)
5) Types of Networks
   1) PAN(Personal Area Network) very small (bluetooth,hotspot)
   2) LAN(Local Area Network) small area (home,office,college lab)
   3) MAN(Metropolitian Area Network) City-wide network
   4) WAN(Wide Area Network) Large area(countries/continents) Example: The internet
6) How Data Travels in a Network
   When you open a website
   1) You type URL(like google.com)
   2) Request goes to DNS server - gets ip address
   3) Data is broken into packets
   4) Packets travel through routers and switches
   5) Reach destination servers
   6) Server sends response back
   This entire process happens in milliseconds
7) IP Address
   Every device in a network has a unique identity called an IP address
   for example: 192.168.1.1
